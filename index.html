      <img src="Vanessa.jpg" width="240" height="400">
      <p>As I had stated earlier I am currently attending CSULB. I am a freshman and I am excited to learn many things in my major, Computer Science. I decided to undergo this major because of all of the possible things that can be created. Also I can make games.</p>

      <h2>Hobbies!!!</h2>
      <h5>I love drawing!!!</h5>
      <img src="drawing.jpeg" width="800" height="400">
      <p>Surprise...</p>
      <p>While yes I do love to play video games as much as any computer science major, I also love to draw. I drew this when I was in 8th grade and was encouraged to participate in an art competition. I didn't win but it was still fun! Drawing allows for me to sketch out code and see where I am at. I draw shapes and arrows to compute a sort of flow chart and it works believe me.</p>

      <h2>Family!!!</h2>
      <h5>A picture of me and my mom!!!</h5>
      <img src="mommy.jpeg" width="400" height="400">
      <p>So it turns out I don't have a full family photo..oops..</p>
      <p>I am the only daughter in my family and the only one to have consistent good grades. I have my parents who both come from Mexico and I also have 3 older brothers. We are all 4 years apart. I am 18 then it's 22, 26, 30 years old. We also have a pet bunny named Sebastian and a dog named Toby. We love to go out to trips with each other and watch movies together. </p>
